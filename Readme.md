1. Run the requirement.txt file on your system terminal. 
>      pip install requirement.txt 
2. Run the main.py file in the terminal. 
3. Enter the Protein PDB Id and Chain according to the requested command.
   > e.g: Enter the chain id here -> 2hrb
   >     Enter the PDB id here -> A
4. The output will get stored in your current directory.
>[!NOTE] it will give the error messeges, if any input go wrong. So, please check the PDB id format and chain id in here ->[RCSB.org](https://www.rcsb.org/)
